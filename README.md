# Emotional NBack
Emotional NBack is one of three tasks used in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development fMRI battery.  This project is unique from previous iterations in that it uses the flexibility of Python and PsychoPy to account for various interuptions that experimenters face, including but not limited to adjusting parameters to complete Run2, incorporating Practice and RecMem in one script, and easily incorporating multiple attempts at the task with the same participants among other benefits.

## Prerequisites
* PsychoPy
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Pyglet

## How to run
Open NBack_Final.py in Coder view and the click "Run".  A dialog box will open and ask for the participant information, Session, run number, and handedness.
